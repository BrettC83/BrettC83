- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrettC83
- 👀 I’m interested in tons of things! For example, since being taught how to code in high school (over 2 decades ago) I've always wanted to be a coder. Not sure why I have not put the time in to learn, but starting to take it more seriously now. 
- I like being outside but don't spend a lot of time outside. Learning how to sail, starting on smaller dingy's but hoping to get into keep boats this summer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, AIML, pretty much anything I can find and have time for. (github is NEW to me, feel free to help!!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that has a potential to make the World a better place. 
- 📫 How to reach me email is best brett.clavelle@gmail.com Email again if I don't respond.
